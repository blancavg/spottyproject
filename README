My goal is to develop an application to show the behavior of search algorithms. Search algorithms aim to find the best path through several nodes.

This assignment shows the basic (extremely basic) idea and sets the foundation of an application to teach algorithms. Spotty is a hamster whose objective is to eat randomly located food that has been placed in the scene. At this stage of the application, Spotty follows the path according to the order of appearance of the items, each item has a label. There are two buttons:

New - It generates a new configuration of randomly placed items. The items are not overlapped.

Ordered - It shows the path according to the label of each item in ascending order. 

Panels:
The left panel shows the x,y point of each item.

The bottom panel shows:

1) Messages according to your actions. For example:
If the button is pressed without a new set of items, a message is displayed, suggesting you to press New.
2) The overall distance from the initial point (Spottie's location) through all the items and finishing in the first location.

Spotty like to be tickled, you can touch it and press the left mouse's button and you will hear Spottie's laugh.

TODO list
The path is not the optimal one, the next version will provide Spotty with smart strategies to eat the food by generating the shortest path.

The user will be able to introduce its own path and compare it with solutions generated by search algorithms (Hill Climbing, A*).

I tested the link with Chrome and audio is ok, however, with Firefox it is muted.
